# Substrate Node Template

A new FRAME-based Substrate node, ready for hacking :rocket:

## Local Development

Follow these steps to prepare a local Substrate development environment :hammer_and_wrench:

### Setup

Setup instructions can be found at the
[Substrate Developer Hub](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/getting-started).

### Build

Once the development environment is set up, build the node template. This command will build the
[Wasm](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/advanced/executor#wasm-execution) and
[native](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/advanced/executor#native-execution) code:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Run

### Single Node Development Chain

Purge any existing dev chain state:

```bash
./target/release/node-template purge-chain --dev
```

Start a dev chain:

```bash
./target/release/node-template --dev
```

Or, start a dev chain with detailed logging:

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug RUST_BACKTRACE=1 ./target/release/node-template -lruntime=debug --dev
```
